                    <h2>What BFAC is?</h2>
                    <p>An obstacle exists only until someone steps up to fix it.</p>
                    <p>We at Build for a Change (BFAC) aim at enabling problem solving through consorted efforts. We provide a platform for creative minds to work together on technical challenges that improve society. Encouraging students to take up socially assistive projects with consistent support from NGOs and technical mentors, and finding feasible solutions is the sole objective of BFAC.</p>
                    <h2>Why BFAC?</h2>
                    <p>We know the hardships the plague millions of people across our country. Lack of primary health care, illiteracy, scarce food resources are just some of the many problems that need to be addressed. NGOs have taken it up upon themselves to alleviate these issues. We hope to aid them in their efforts. We intend to break the technical barriers that hinder NGOs and let their efforts reap the rewards they deserve.</p>

                    <h2>How we function?</h2>
                    <p>The problems we put up are framed by NGOs and people who have had immense experience in associated fields. Students sign up for problems and work with self-set deadlines and milestones. For technical assistance, we take aid from professionals and mentors who too are inclined to work for a social cause. Finally the projects are reviewed by NGOs and mentors, and are taken up for further development by incubators. Resulting in the project turning into a prototype ready to be introduced to the market. The underlying goal is for these prototypes to be cost effective and easily available to the NGOs for use.</p>
