# Build For A Change
We at Build for a Change (BFAC) aim at enabling problem solving through consorted efforts. We provide a platform for creative minds to work together on technical challenges that improve society. Encouraging students to take up socially assistive projects with consistent support from NGOs and technical mentors, and finding feasible solutions is the sole objective of BFAC.
